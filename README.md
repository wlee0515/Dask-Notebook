# Dask-Notebook
A Docker swaem deployment to run Jupyter-Lab in sn environment setup with Dask. The number of Dask Workers is scalable using Docker Swarm's scale replica functionality.

Once deployed, Jupyter-Lab and Dask-Dashboard will be available from localhost

Jupyter-Lab : http://localhost:8888

Dask-Dashboard : http://localhost:8787

The root directory of Jupyter lab is mapped to the folder [playground](./playground). Files saved in Jupyter-Lab will be available in the [playground](./playground) folder.
